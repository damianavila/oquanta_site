**Company Mission**
   We will analize your data and generate suitable models to help you understand your domain-specific problems.  

**More about us** 
   We have development experience solving complex real-world problems. 

   Our areas of expertise include finance, biostatistics, and the growing  category of data science.

   We have focused on scientific computing, algorithm development, graphics and interactive data visualization. 

   We are pythonic boys. So we use IPython, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib as a core scientific Python.    

   We also embrace new pythonic libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels and Scikit-learn.

   We are headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

**Our team in action**
